    "#### Q1. Is it permissible to use several import statements to import the same module? What would the goal be? Can you think of a situation where it would be beneficial ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Yes, it is permissible to use several import statements to import the same module. It is used in case when we have to import multiple functions from same module. "

    "- **`__doc__`** : It denotes the documentation string line written in a module code.\n",
    "- **`__file__`** : It holds the name and path of the module file from which it is loaded\n",
    "- **`__dict__`** : It return a dictionary object of module attributes, functions and other definitions and their respective values"

    "#### Q3. Circular importing, such as when two modules import each other, can lead to dependencies and bugs that aren't visible. How can you go about creating a program that avoids mutual importing?\n",
    "**Ans:** Circular importing means importing the two modules in each other. If suppose we are wokring in `MOD1.py` file and it is importing some function say F2() from some other module say\n",
    "`MOD2.PY` file or we can do vice-versa. What will happen is: This will give an `import error`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because when we import F2() function from module `MOD2.py`, then this will execute `MOD2.py` file. And in `MOD2.py` file there is an another statement of importing `MOD1.py` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will result in endless loop. To avoid this error just do one thingWe can use if `__name__ == '__main__'`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the function, you can't directly refer to the function in the program. The addition of this sentence avoids the endless loop of the program ."

    "#### Q5. In what situation is it useful to refer to the `__name__` attribute or the string `__main_ _` ?\n",
    "**Ans:** During the time of execution of the code if we want to refer the module in which we are working on then we uses name attribute. In that case it will return the module in which we are working on. Suppose if that moudle is being imported from some other module then name will have the name of that moudle from where the current module has been imported. The current module in which we are working is refer to the string `__main __`."

    "#### Q6. What are some of the benefits of attaching a program counter to the RPN interpreter application, which interprets an RPN script line by line?\n",
    "**Ans:** The benefits of attaching a program counter to an RPN interpreter application:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sequential Execution:\n",
    "By using a program counter variable, you can iterate through the RPN script line by line using a loop, such as a for loop or while loop. The program counter variable serves as an index to keep track of the current line being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Control Flow:\n",
    "With a program counter, you can implement conditional branching and looping constructs in Python. For example, you can use if statements to check conditions and modify the program counter accordingly to jump to different sections of the script. Similarly, while loops or for loops can be used to repeat a certain block of code based on the value of the program counter.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Error Handling:\n",
    "By utilizing try-except blocks, you can handle errors or exceptions that occur during the execution of RPN script lines. If an error occurs, you can catch it using an except block, perform appropriate error handling operations, and adjust the program counter accordingly to handle the situation gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Debugging and Tracing:\n",
    "Python provides various debugging tools and techniques. You can add print statements or use a debugger to display the current value of the program counter as the script executes. This allows you to trace the execution path and identify any issues or unexpected behavior by observing the program counter's value at different points in the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Script Analysis:\n",
    "By incorporating additional logic around the program counter, you can collect statistics and perform analysis on the RPN script execution. For example, you can maintain counters to track the number of lines executed, measure the time taken per line, or record the frequency of specific operations. This data can be used for optimization, profiling, or gaining insights into the script's behavior."

    "#### Q7. What are the minimum expressions or statements (or both) that you'd need to render a basic programming language like RPN primitive but completeâ€” that is, capable of carrying out any computerised task theoretically possible?\n",
    "**Ans:** To render a basic programming language like RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) primitive but complete, capable of carrying out any theoretically possible computerized task, you would need the following minimum expressions and statements:\n",

    "    - Push: Pushes a value onto the stack.\n",
    "    - Pop: Removes and retrieves the top value from the stack.\n",
    "    - Duplicate: Creates a copy of the top value on the stack.\n",
    "    - Swap: Exchanges the positions of the top two values on the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Conditional Statements:\n",
    "    - If-Else: Allows branching based on a condition. Executes different code blocks depending on whether the condition is true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Looping Statements:\n",
    "    - For Loop: Repeats a block of code a specified number of times.\n",
    "    - While Loop: Repeats a block of code while a given condition is true.\n",
    "    - Loop Control: Statements like 'continue' and 'break' to control the flow within loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Input/Output:\n",
    "    - Input: Enables reading user input or data from external sources.\n",
    "    - Output: Allows displaying or printing values or results.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Variables:\n",
    "    - Variable Declaration: Statements to declare and initialize variables.\n",
    "    - Variable Assignment: Assigns values to variables.\n",
    "    - Variable Access: Retrieves the value stored in a variable.\n",

    "7. Functions/Procedures:\n",
    "    - Function/Procedure Declaration: Defines reusable code blocks with input parameters and a return value.\n",
    "    - Function/Procedure Call: Executes the code block with specified arguments and returns a result.\n",
